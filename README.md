| Version | TBD |


### Abstract   

The KOBSearch is a search service that provides a registered user with the information about the organizations (or members of the organization) that are operating in the city of Cochin and registered with KochiOrgBook (KOB). KOB is like a directory that will contain the verifiable data about the organizations thus enabling trusted digital verification service.

### Dependent Projects

KOBSearch is a UI plug-in that will run on [KOBConnect](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBConnect) Wallet App.

### Motivation

In the existing scenario, there are many possibilites for crimes (like document forgery) and other fraudulent activities. This makes it difficult for a citizen to confirm the original identity of various associations or people and thereby fall into the traps set by cheaters. That means, there is an element of trust that is missing.  Inorder to avoid this, finding authentic and authoritative data about people or orgaiztaion, has become a crucial factor. KOBSearch helps to achieve this.

### Status of the project

Incubation

### Solution

KOBSearch helps the people to establish a trusted relationship with an entity (can be an organization or a member of the organization) by confirming their identities. KOB serves as a searchable public directory containing open verifiable data about the organizations that are operating in the city of Cochin. Talking about organizations, it can be any associations or service providers that are decentralized. Once registered, they get a digital identity of their own. 

A citizen can avail the service of KOBSearch to quickly verify if the entity is a legitimate one or not. The citizen is able to easily retrieve data regarding the entity in the form of verifiable credentials. The data can include registration ID, registration status, registration date and other essential details. These data are cryptographically verified ones; so a citizen can completely trust the informations. Since these are decentarlized, one need not worry about the revoking of these identities all of a sudden.
