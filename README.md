|--- | ---|
| Version | *TBD* |


### Abstract   

The KOBSearch is a search service that provides a registered user with the information about the organizations or members of the organization, that are operating in the city of Cochin and registered with KochiOrgBook (KOB). It is the KOBAW (KOB Association Wallet) that will contain the verifiable data about the organizations thus enabling trusted digital verification service. The search can be performed at two levels:
1. Wallet level : *To search for the details about an organizations*
2. VCR level :  *To search for the details about the members of an organization*

### Dependent Projects

KOBSearch is a UI plug-in that will run on [KOBConnect](https://github.com/hyperledgerkochi/KOBConnect) Wallet App.

### Motivation

In the existing scenario, there are many possibilities for document frauds like forging, counterfeiting, altering, falsification etc. This makes it difficult for a citizen to confirm the original identity of various associations or people and thereby fall into the traps set by cheaters. That means, there is an element of trust that is missing. In order to avoid this, finding authentic and authoritative data about people or organization, has become a crucial factor. KOBSearch provides the facility of searching for the data that they can trust. 

### Status of the project

Incubation

### Solution

KOBSearch helps the people to establish a trusted relationship with an entity (can be an organization or a member of the organization) by confirming their identities. KOBAW serves as a searchable public wallet containing open verifiable data about the organizations that are operating in the city of Cochin. Once registered with KOBAW, the entities get a digital identity of their own. 

A citizen can avail the service of KOBSearch to quickly verify if the entity is a legitimate one or not. The citizen is able to easily retrieve data regarding the entity in the form of verifiable credentials. The data can include registration ID, registration status, registration date and other essential details. These data are cryptographically verified ones; so a citizen can completely trust the information.
